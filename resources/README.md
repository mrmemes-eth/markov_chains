# Note about these files

The file `metamorphosis.txt` is the fully annotated [Project Gutenberg](pg)
version of Franz Kafka's _Metamorphosis_. The file
`metamorphosis-text-only.txt` is a version of that same file with the metadata
headers and footers from Project Gutenberg stripped away for ease of
processing. It is present in order to be used as a corpus for testing the
Markov Chaining functions.
